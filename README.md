## Contributing

- For the sake of fairness, add your information in alphabetical order, based on the first letter or character of your TikTok profile name.
- Please don't add someone else's account. Only add your own.
- Your "Channel Description" should be a short overivew of what you try to do with your videos. Are they informational/instructive? Are you a CS student? Learning coding on your own? Humor? Randomness?
- If your description isn't helpful or clear enough, that will be addressed in the PR review. Use good spelling and grammar.
- The "Social Link" column should be where you'd want people to contact you outside of TikTok. Can be your GitHub profile, Discord account/server, Twitter link, etc.
- The maintainers (currently [creativedrewy](https://www.tiktok.com/@creativedrewy)) of this repo reserve the right to reject any profile for any reason. If you have a toxic profile, your PR won't be approved. Sorry.
- Instead, let's build an awesome community that includes everyone!
