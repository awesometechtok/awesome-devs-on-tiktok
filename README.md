There are tons of people making great developer and coding-oriented content on TikTok; let's bring everyone together on one master list! Go follow, like, and interact with everyone on this list - let's build an amazing developer community together. **And most importantly, add yourself to the list!**

**_NOTE_**: This list is only meant for accounts that are actively creating developer-oriented content. If you're a developer who's on TikTok but you aren't actively creating content, why not get started? It'd be great to have you on this list!

- Add your account & social info to the master list
- [Make a Pull Request from your fork back here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

## Contributing

- For the sake of fairness, add your information in alphabetical order, based on the first letter or character of your TikTok profile name.
- Please don't add someone else's account. Only add your own.
- Your "Channel Description" should be a short overivew of what you try to do with your videos. Are they informational/instructive? Are you a CS student? Learning coding on your own? Humor? Randomness?
- If your description isn't helpful or clear enough, that will be addressed in the PR review. Use good spelling and grammar.
- The "Social Link" column should be where you'd want people to contact you outside of TikTok. Can be your GitHub profile, Discord account/server, Twitter link, etc.
- The maintainers (currently [creativedrewy](https://www.tiktok.com/@creativedrewy)) of this repo reserve the right to reject any profile for any reason. If you have a toxic profile, your PR won't be approved. Sorry.
- Instead, let's build an awesome community that includes everyone!
